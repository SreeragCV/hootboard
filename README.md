# Weather App
This is a simple weather application created using Vite and React. It allows users to input a location and fetch weather data for that location.

# How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

# Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SreeragCV/hootboard.git
cd weather-app

# Install Dependencies
npm install

# Start the Development Server
npm run dev

If it doesn't open automatically, you can access the application at http://localhost:5173/

# Build for Production
If you want to build the application for production, use the following command:

# npm run build
This command will generate optimized production-ready assets in the dist folder.

# Additional Notes
Make sure you have an internet connection to fetch weather data from the API.
Customize the application as needed and have fun exploring weather data!
